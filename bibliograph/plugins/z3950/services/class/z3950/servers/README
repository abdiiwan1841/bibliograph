The XML files in this folder are drawn from 

http://irspy.indexdata.com/

you can add any Z39.50 Server listed on this page by downloading the xml
file behind the link "XML" at the end of each line. 

Please note the following: 

 - You should remove the <irspy:status xmlns:irspy="http://indexdata.com/irspy/1.0">
   node, it is not needed and increases the size of the file needlessly.
   
 - The XML document must contain a recordInfo node like so:
 
   <recordInfo>
     <recordSyntax name="USmarc">
       <elementSet name="F"></elementSet>
     </recordSyntax>
     <recordSyntax name="Unimarc">
       <elementSet name="F"></elementSet>
     </recordSyntax>
     <recordSyntax name="Picamarc">
       <elementSet name="F"></elementSet>
     </recordSyntax>
     <recordSyntax name="SUTRS">
       <elementSet name="F"></elementSet>
     </recordSyntax>
     <recordSyntax name="MAB">
       <elementSet name="F"></elementSet>
     </recordSyntax>
   </recordInfo> 

  - Currently (as of v2.1), only the following record syntaxes are supported: 
    - USmarc
    
  - Please not that the "SUTRS" record syntax is not supported, i.e. Z39.50 
    servers that offer only SUTRS (like the British Library, as of 06/2015) 
    cannot be used.
