No-Nonsense Forum Plugin
===========================

This plugin integrates the NoNonsenseForum. See

http://camendesign.com/nononsense_forum
https://github.com/Kroc/NoNonsenseForum

The code has been adapted for integration with Bibliograph.

The integration is very basic, it just opens a new tab/window with the forum
in it. When accessing the forum through the Help > User Forum menu, user and 
password information are automatically set (Password is generated and not taken
from user account). 

The super-admin name is set to "Administrator", so please make sure to post
once with this name to prevent others from taking it.
