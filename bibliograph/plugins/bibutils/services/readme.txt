This plugin makes use of the bibutis package by Chris Putnam

http://www.scripps.edu/~cdputnam/software/bibutils/#bib2xml

You will have to install the bibutis binaries, either compiling
them yourself, using one of the prebuilt binaries from the website,
or a package of your linux distribution. Make sure the executables
are on the PATH, or alternative define the BIBUTILS_PATH constant
in your config.php file.
