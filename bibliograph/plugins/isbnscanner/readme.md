isbnscanner Plugin
==================

Status: experimental

This plugin provides import of books with an ISBN scanner. It is not production-
ready and therefore not supported at the moment. 

Usage: Use a standard ISBN scanner in keyboard mode. By scanning a random ISBN,
the import dialog is triggered (you can also open it through the "import" menu).
Then scan the ISBN of the book you want to import. It should then look up the
ISBN using a web service and, after confirmation, import its metadata into the
current folder.
