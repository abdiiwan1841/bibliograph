Sponsor a feature
=================
If you need a particular feature, you can hire me to delevop it. Write to
info at bibliograph dot org. Possible features are:
- a mobile version
- a library book checkout system
- sync with desktop reference managers
 
and much more. I'll be happy to develop a plugin for your particular need.

Features/changes that might be implemented or not, depending on
my free time & sufficient interest:

Version 2.2
===========

- New plugin: share reference on twitter, facebook, etc. 
- New plugin: lookup reference in library catalogues -> where is book available
- New plugin: Zotero connector
- New plugin: NodeJS-based realtime messaging, the current PHP solution just #
  doesn't cut it.
- Move authors & keywords to own tables to allow metadata connections
