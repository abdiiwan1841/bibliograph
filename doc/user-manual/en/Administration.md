Administration
==============
::: {dir="ltr"}
Next to the possibilities onf managing and viewing records, *Bibliograph* offers an additional set of functions for the administration of the application itself. To access these functions, the assignement of certain permissions is necessary. These are in general reserved for the **administrator**.
If you are in possession of these permissions, you have access the following functions:
-   Creation of new [users](administration/creating-a-new-user.html)and [databases](administration/new-database.html)
-   Administration of roles, groups and permissions via the [access control tool](administration/access-control.html)
-   [Administration of Plugins](administration/administration-plugins.html)
-   Creations and deletion of [Backups](administration/backups.html)
-   the irreversible deletion of records by [emptying the trash folder](administration/empty-trash.html)
-   [additional administration options](administration/additional-functions.html)
Furthermore, there are certain steps the admin has to take when installing and using the application for the first time. More information on this can be found [here](administration/first-steps.html).
