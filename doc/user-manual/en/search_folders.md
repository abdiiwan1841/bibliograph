search folders
==============
::: {dir="ltr"}
Additional to normal folders, Bibliograph enables you to create so-called search folders. You recognize them by the magnifier next to the folder icon. In a search folder, you do not need to place every single record manually. Instead you tag it with a query. Every record matching this query is now automatically placed in your search folder. This does not only apply for all records currently available in your database, but also for all future records matching your query.[

[However, search folders are, just like the normal search tool, always restricted to one database.]{style="line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent"}

To create a search folder, you proceed in the same way as you do when creating a normal folder. Click the plus-sign underneath the [folder view](../introduction/user-surface/folder-view.html), name the folder and choose the type 'Search folder'. Confirm your changes with *[Ok]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}*. The new folder will now be shown in the folder view. Mark the folder and click the radio button underneath the folder view. Choose [*Edit folder data*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}.

A new window will open. It is essential that you enter a ['query'. When creating the query, stick to the [search syntax](../view-records/data-search/search-syntax.html) of *Bibliograph*.]{style="color:rgb(255,0,0)"}

A search folder can always be changed back into a normal folder. The records that have been collected in the search folder until the change, will remain but all records containing the query, that are added to *Bibliograph* after your change, will not be collected.
