Move folders
============
::: {dir="ltr"}
To move one folder into another, mark the folder and choose the command [*Move folder*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"} via the radio button beneath the [folder view](../introduction/user-surface/folder-view.html). In a new window, you can pick any folder in your database. By marking one of them and using the [*Select*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}-button, you will add the formerly chosen folder as a subfolder.
