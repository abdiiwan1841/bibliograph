Change folder visibility
========================
::: {dir="ltr"}
You can change a folder's visibility by marking the respective folder, clicking the radio button underneath the [folder view](../introduction/user-surface/folder-view.html) and choosing the option [*Change visibility*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}.
Now you can set the folder to public visibility. All users, even those not registered with Bibliograph, can now look at it's contents. Otherwise, you can put the settings to [*Folder is not publically visible*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}, which restricts it's visibility to users that are registered and have access to this database. The access of assigned users, however, cannot be restricted any further.
Furthermore, you can decide whether you only want to change the settings for this folder, or for all it's subfolders as well.
