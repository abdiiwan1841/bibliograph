On this page we will collect problems that appear frequently and preset their solutions. You can always write an e-mail to info at bibliograph dot org, if you recognise any malfunctions in the application or have problems with the online help.

**First tip:**
If anything does not work, reload the database. This will help in most cases.

**I give in data, but they will not become visible (e.g. in the short list)**
Refresh the page.

**I can't register.**
If you have forgotten your password, click the corresponding button in the 'Register'-Window and you will get a new one. If the problem is of another kind, please contact your admin.
