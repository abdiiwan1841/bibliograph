Additional administration options
=================================
::: {dir="ltr"}
::: {dir="ltr"}


Next to the already desribed administrational features of *Bibliograph*, there are a few more functions available. To access those, choose 'System' in the tool bar and press *[Preferences]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}*. A new window will open, containing four different tabs:
**
Apperance**
Here you can alter the [*application title*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}. Furthermore, the *[application logo]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}* is saved here and can be changed as well.
**Fields**
**Access**
The administrator is able to choose between two different *[access modes]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}*. Next to the normal one which allows every user to Log-in, *Bibliograph* can also be put into Read-Only mode. This mode withdraws all users without administration rights to enter the application. The Read-Only mode can be used to work on records, making sure that others users will not simultaniously make changes as well.
If a normal user tries to log in while *Bibliograph* is in Read-Only, he will see a message, telling him that he is not able to login an the moment. This user information can be completed with additional information in the *[Cusom Message]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}* field.

**Import by ISBN**
Here you can choose between two different ways in which data imported via ISBN should be converted into a sortable format. The two options available are [*Name Parser*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"} and *[Web Service]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}*, the later one taking longer for the convertion.
