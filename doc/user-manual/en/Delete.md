Delete
======
::: {dir="ltr"}
If you want to delete a record, mark it and click the minus sign beneath the [short list](../introduction/user-surface/short-list.html). The record is moved into the trash folder.
When deleting a folder, you follow the same steps, using the minus sign underneath the [folder view](../introduction/user-surface/folder-view.html).
For safety reasons, the clearance of the trash folder and therefore the irreversible deletion is not allowed to most users. If you do not have the necessary rights to use this function and demand an irreversible deletion, please contact your admin.
