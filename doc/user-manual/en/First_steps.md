First steps
===========
::: {dir="ltr"}
When the application is used for the first time, the following standart settings will be created:
-   a user [*admin*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"} is produced. The password for this user is *[admin]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}* as well. This user is put into the Administrator Role
-   two databases will be created, *[database1 ]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}*and *[database2]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}*. Both are not public but only visible for the Administrator (This is why you will see an error report telling you that you have no access to the databases on this server when activating the Bibliograph-URL for the second time)
To customize the application, follow these steps:
-   register with *[admin/admin]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}*. The scrren will look like this:

:::

-   press the [*Administrator* ]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}button on the left
-   a window will open in which you can enter the Administrator's email address and a new password. It is strongly recommende to change the password! You have to enter the new one twice to avoid any typos.
-   Now choose the [access control tool](access-control.html) to add users, groups, databases and roles.
