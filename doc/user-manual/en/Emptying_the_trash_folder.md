Emptying the trash folder
=========================
::: {dir="ltr"}
Every registered user can delete records in *Bibliograph*. Instructions on how to do this can be found [here](../manage-records/delete.html).
However, this way the deleted data will only be moved to the trash folder where they are still available. The irreversible deletion of data is restricted to the administrator for security reasons.
To perform a final deletion, the trash folder needs to be cleared. To do so, choose [*Empty trash...*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"} by using the radio button beneath the folder view. Confirm your choice with [*Ok*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}.
