Change folder settings
======================
::: {dir="ltr"}
::: {dir="ltr"}

To change a folder, mark it and choose the option *[Edit folder data]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}* by clicking on the radio button beneath the [folder view](../introduction/user-surface/folder-view.html).
You can select several settings:
**Folder title**
Change the name of the folder
**Description**
Short description of the folder
**[[Is]{style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"} ]{style="color:rgb(255,0,0)"}folder publically visible?**
If you put the folder's settings to public, it is available for everyone, even guest users.
*Hint: It is impossible to create a folder that is only visible for yourself. However, you can ask your administrator to create a private database, if you wish.
Hint: If you would like to change the visibility of subfolders, it is useful to use the function 'Change visibility'*
**Search folder?**
Here you decide, whether you want to create a normal folder or a search folder.
**Query**
[â†’](search-folders.html)Search folder

**Opened?**
Decide, whether the folder should expand automatically when starting the application

Your changes are saved by clicking [*Ok*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}.
