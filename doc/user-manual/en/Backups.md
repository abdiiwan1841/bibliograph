Backups
=======
::: {dir="ltr"}
To access the backups, Choose 'System' in the tool bar and then take the option *[backups]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}*. You can either create a new backup, restore and old one or delete saved ones.
To set *Bibliograph* back into a former condition, choose *[Restore Backup]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}* and confirm with [*Ok*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}. A new window will open, listing all existing backups of the database with the corresponding time of their creation. Click the designated backup, confirm again with [*Ok* ]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}and the database will be set back.
Choosing [*Delete old Backups*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"} will delete all backups that have been saved before 12pm of the previous day.
