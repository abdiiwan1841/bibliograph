The bibliographic data in *Bibliograph* is collected in different folders. One folder may contain other folders, search folders and records.
The folder view shows all folders contained in one database. It shows the folder's name (1) as well as the number of all records directly included in this folder (2). If one folder is chosen, it's contents are shown in the short list.
Folders can contain subfolders. In this case, there is an arrow on the left side of the folder-icon to open it.
The button on the right side of the header (3) can be used to change the columns shown in the list.

The folder view can be reloaded seperate from the rest of the application by using the radio button.
There are additional functions in the folder view that can be used by a user with corresponding rights. These will be explained in the following sections.
