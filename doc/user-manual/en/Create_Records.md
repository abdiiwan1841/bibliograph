[To create a record, a folder needs to be open since records cannot be created outside of a folder. Just choose a folder in the [folder view](../introduction/user-surface/folder-view.html) on the left side.]{style="line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent"}

Now click on the plus-button on the left side below the short list. A new window will open in which you can choose a classification (monography, miscellany, magazine article etc.). Confirm your choice with [*select*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}.
You can now, as well as at any later point of time, edit the record's information. The classification can be changed again as well.

Sometimes it is not necessary to create a new record. It might be easier to simply [import](import-records.html)it from one of the different sources available to *Bibliograph*.

To create a new record, you need to possess the necessary rights. Usually every registered user can create records. If you, however, are not able to use this tool, please get in touch with your admin.
