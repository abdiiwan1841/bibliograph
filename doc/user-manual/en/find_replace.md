find/replace
============
::: {dir="ltr"}
The 'find/replace' order allows you to serach for a precise search expression in a folder, a record or a complete database und to replace this serach term with another expression.
To use it, click the radio button underneath the short list and choose [*Edit references*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}.
If you now click [*find/replace*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}, a new window will pop open. First you have to choose whether you want to limit your search to one record, one folder, or search the whole database. Then you have to set, where you want to search for your tearm, e.g. in authors, in the title or the abstract. Now type in your search expression and the term you want to replace it with. Cofirm your changes with [*Ok*]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}.
The last question in the pop up window will be 'Create a backup?'. Since it is very complicated, if not impossible, to undo the changes made with this function, you are urgently advised to create a backup before implementing the changes. If you do not have the necessary rights to create a backup, please consult your admin.
