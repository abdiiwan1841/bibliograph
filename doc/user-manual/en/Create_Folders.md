Create Folders
==============
::: {dir="ltr"}
Every new database automatically contains a default folder, created as a normal folder. However, you have the option to create additional folders, subfolder and search folders. The [folder view](../introduction/user-surface/folder-view.html) gives you and overview of all folders in one database.
To create a new folder, click on the plus-sign beneath the folder view. A new window will pop open. Enter the new folders name in the designated field and confirm your changes with *[Ok]{style="color:rgb(102,102,102)"}*.
New folders are always creates as **normal folders**. You should maintain this setting, if you want to create a standart folder for filing records. The second type of folder, the search folder, enables you create records containing a specitic search term.
You can now, as well as at any later point, change your folder settings.
