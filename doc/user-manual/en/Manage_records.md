Manage records
==============
::: {dir="ltr"}
In case a user has got the corresponding rights, he has the possibility to manage records in addition to just viewing them.
You might be able to create new records, change existing ones or import records from external databases. The addition, deletion or alteration of normal folders and search folders are possible, too. Beyond that, the user can switch between different databases in *Bibliograph*.
In general, these rights are restricted to registered users. If you are unable to use any of the mentioned functions, please contact your admin.
