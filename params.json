If you want to use different names or use only one database, \r\n  adapt the settings in the [database] section of bibliograph.ini.php.\r\n- Give the bibliograph user ALL rights for these databases\r\n- Rename services/config/server.conf.dist.php in services/config/server.conf.php\r\n- Enter the email address of the administrator of the installation in the \r\n  [admin.email] section in services/config/bibliograph.ini.php\r\n\r\nOptional\r\n--------\r\n- To import from library databases, you need to install the php YAZ extension \r\n  (http://www.indexdata.com/phpyaz):\r\n  https://code.google.com/p/list8d/wiki/InstallingYaz\r\n  and the php-xsl extension (Debian: apt-get install php5-xsl)\r\n- To enable export and import of various bibliographic data formats, install the \r\n  bibutils toolset (Debian: apt-get install bibutils) and adapt the BIBUTILS_PATH \r\n  constant in config/server.conf.php\r\n- If you want to allow backups, install the php zip extension and grant the global \r\n  \"RELOAD\" privilege to the \"bibliograph\" user. if the backups should not be \r\n  stored in the system tempdir, adapt the BIBLIOGRAPH_BACKUP_PATH\r\n  constant in config/server.conf.php and point it to a world-writable folder \r\n  outside the document root of the web server.\r\n- You can connect a ldap server for authentication (adapt config/bibliograph.ini.php)\r\n\r\nFirst run\r\n---------\r\n- fire up a browser and open the \"build\" folder. If problems with the setup \r\n  occur, error messages will be displayed and will tell you to fix the problems.\r\n- After the setup has fininished, reload the page and login as \"Admin\"/\"admin\"\r\n- Got to System -> Plugins. Install the plugins you need.\r\n- Reload and you should be all set.\r\n\r\nDeployment\r\n----------\r\n- Securing the Server: The PHP backend has one single entry-point: \r\n  services/server.php. If you want to make sure no other PHP script is called, \r\n  restrict access to php files to this path.\r\n- It is recommended to create a redirection from the top-level path to the \r\n  bibliograph/build folder\r\n- By default, Bibliograph stores persistent data in the system temporary folder \r\n  (on Linux, this is usually /tmp). This is fine for testing the application, \r\n  but can lead to the loss of data whenever this folder is automatically cleaned\r\n  up by the OS. For permanent production installations, you MUST change the \r\n  QCL_VAR_DIR constant in services/config/server.conf.php to a world-writable \r\n  directory outside the document root of the web server.\r\n- Before using the software in a production environment, change the password of \r\n  the \"Admin\" user, delete the \"Manager\" and \"User\" users and configure your own \r\n  users in the System > Acces Control tool.\r\n- Change the access.enforce_https_login preference in config/bibliograph.ini.php \r\n  to \"yes\" so that passwords are not sent in plain text.\r\n- Change the QCL_APPLICATION_MODE constant in config/server.conf.php to \r\n  \"production\". When you need to apply updates, change it back to \"maintenance\".\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n-------\r\n- Online documentation is here: http://www.bibliograph.org. Most of it is still\r\n  in German, but English documentation will be added once there is some interest.\r\n- For general questions, please write to info at bibliograph dot org or send \r\n  a tweet to @bibliograph2. A support mailing list may follow.\r\n- Bugs and feature requests should be registered as github issues:\r\n  https://github.com/cboulanger/bibliograph/issues\r\n- Paid support for installation or hosting is available, also if you need a plugin\r\n  to support your particular collection.\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n-----------\r\nThis is open source software, everybody is invited to hack on the code and help \r\nmake it better! Bug fixes and new plugins are very welcome.\r\n- Get the code by cloning it from git@github.com:cboulanger/bibliograph.git \r\n  (Most easily, by cloning it at GitHub itself).\r\n- Building the application requires the qooxdoo library (v3.5.1, v4.0 might work, \r\n  but is not tested):\r\n  - Download the 3.5.1 SDK from \r\n    http://sourceforge.net/projects/qooxdoo/files/qooxdoo-current/\r\n  - Unzip the SDK into a top-level \"qooxdoo\" folder. You can also adapt the path\r\n    to the SDK in the bibliograph/config.json configuration file if you don't \r\n    want to store it there. For development, the location of the SDK files must \r\n    be accessible to the web server.\r\n  - Issue \"./generate build\" in the \"bibliograph\" folder.\r\n- For deployment, you only need to copy the bibliograph/build and \r\n  bibliograph/services folders to the production server. The rest is only \r\n  necessary to build the application.\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n-------\r\n- The current roadmap is here: \r\n  https://github.com/cboulanger/bibliograph/blob/master/roadmap.md\r\n- If you wish to sponsor a feature, please contact info@bibliograph.org\r\n\r\nI am not a developer. How can I contribute to the project?\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n- You can donate and make sure development continues:\r\n  http://sourceforge.net/p/bibliograph/donate\r\n- You can help spread the word. The more people use the application, the more\r\n  likely it is that development continues and new features/plugins will be \r\n  added.\r\n- You can provide feedback and suggest changes or features.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n--------\r\nOpen source libraries\r\n- qooxdoo JavaScript framework: (c)  1&1 Internet AG \r\n  http://www.qooxdoo.org\r\n- CSL - The Citation Style Language.
